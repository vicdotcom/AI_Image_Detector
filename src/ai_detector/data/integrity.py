Integrity, Fingerprinting and Duplicate-Detection Utilities

This is an image integrity and preprocessing module. Prior to training the AI image detector, we first need to understand the dataset feeding it. For instance, for a set of images within a dataset:
```
image_001.jpg
image_002.jpg
image_003.jpg
image_004.jpg
```

We may find:
```
image_001.jpg ───── exact copy ───── image_002.jpg

image_003.jpg ───── resized version ───── image_004.jpg
```
Which can cause data leakages in the event of splitting to training and evaluation sets.


This module provides utilities for assessing image integrity and preventing
data leakage in machine learning pipelines. It ensures that:
- Data leakage is prevented when splitting datasets into train/evaluation
  sets by detecting duplicate or near-duplicate images
- Images are uncorrupted and can be opened and processed



The module performs integrity checks at multiple levels of image representation:

```

    This function checks whether the image is fully decodable.

    A decodable image is simply an uncorrupted file. This means its pixels can be successfully read, decompressed, and processed without errors.

    An image file (i.e.- .jpg, .png) is normally structured as follows.
      - Header and Metadata- Dimensions (1920x1080), color profiles, EXIF (technical image details such as location, time and date, camera settings, device info)
      - Compressed pixel payload
    
    An image can therefore fail to decode via:
      - Header Corruption- The image file is garbage or the file may not even be an image at all
      - Truncation or Payload Corruption- The header is perfectly fine but the pixel stream is broken or missing (i.e.- The full image is not loaded). Can occur due to network connections dropping halfway through a download or web scrape.

    Therefore, a two-stage check is applied to ensure each aspect of the image is decodable:
      - Stage 1 (`Image.verify()`)- Checks header markers and basic formatting.
      - Stage 2 (`Image.load()`)- Uncompresses and decodes every single pixel.

    This functon serves as an input in the pHash function where the actual DCT transformation takes place. Via the DCT process, it helps pHash to know what kind of patterns (or frequencies) make up a particular image.

    The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a mathematical method that changes an image from the spatial domain (raw pixel values) to the frequency domain (cosine wave components). It essnetially splits the image into high and low frequency parts where:
      - Low frequencies (Top left)- Represent broad patterns, shaped, smooth gradients, overall illumination, large scale structure
      - High frequencies (Botton right)- Represents egdes, fine textures, sharp details, rapid color transitions
    
    It serves as a core image compression tool with most of the visual data packed into the top-left corner:
    ```
    Spatial Domain (Pixel Grid)            Frequency Domain (DCT Output)
    [ [120, 122, 125, ...],                [ [ DC ,  F1,  F2, ...],
    [118, 119, 121, ...],   === DCT ===>   [  F3,  F4,  F5, ...],

    (Brightness at (x, y))                 (Amplitude of Cosine Patterns)
    ```

    Where the [DC] term represents zero-frequency; simply the overall mean brightness of the entire image.

    To facilitate the DCT process, this function returns an nxn orthonormal matrix D. The actual transformation occurs as follows:
    
    $$
    DCT_freq= dct_matrix * image_pixel_columns * dct_matrix_transposed

    This function produces a percenptual hash. Unlike an ordinary hash function such as `sha_256_file()` above, this function checks visual similarity rather than strict identical copies.

    The rationale for this function is that say Image A is the photograph of a dog. Image B may be the same photograph though resized, cropped, made brighted/darker, and so on....

    A DCT transformation is applied to each image and an 8x8 grid containing the lowest frequencies are stored as shown below then hashed.

    From the above image, the top left 8x8 grid is selected after applying the DCT transformation as it contains the most visual information.

    The 8x8 frequency matrix is hashed to return a hexadecimal hash string.

    Known failure mode: near-uniform images (flat black, flat sky) have almost
    no low-frequency structure, so their hashes collapse together and produce
    false "duplicates". While this function is still useful to ensure diverse training input, threshold flags should be examined manually.

    This is the core function that tells us whether any two images are similar via computing the Hamming Distance between their pHashes (`hex_a` and `hex_b`).

    Hamming Distance is a metric that measures how different two equal-length sequences (strings (i.e.- hashes), bit arrays, vectors, etc) are from each other. From the pHashes obtained:
        - 0 to 5 differing bits: Almost certainly the same image (or minor edits/compression).
        - 6 to 10 differing bits: Similar content with moderate edits.
        - greater than 12 differing bits: Completely different images

    The hashes are however not compared directly:
        1. The pHash hexadecimal strings for each image are first converted into integers 
        2. `^` (XOR operation) then compares the integer values bitwise. 
        3. The comparison result is comverted into a binary representation via `bin()` (since `int` objects to not have a `count()` method. `str` objects do)
        4. If bits are the same (0), if different (1). The number of differences is the Hamming Distance.
