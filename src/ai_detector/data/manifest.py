Manifest Module
===============

This module creates a manifest that serves as the single source of truth 
for the project. It constructs an authoritative description of the dataset 
by transforming a collection of image files into a structured table where 
each row represents one image and each column represents a known property 
of that image. This is a standard practice in data engineering for 
structuring data.

With each image explicitly defined, the module enables better dataset 
splitting into train, evaluation, and testing sets.

Data Flow
---------

The transformation pipeline follows this structure:
```
    RAW DATA
        │
        ▼
    manifest.py
        │
        ▼
┌───────────────┐
│   MANIFEST    │
│               │
│ image 1       │
│ image 2       │
│ image 3       │
│ ...           │
└───────────────┘
    ▲    ▲    ▲
    │    │    │
train  test  eval
```

Module Dependencies
-------------------

This module draws from :mod:`integrity.py` to define the ideal train/
evaluation dataset split while minimizing data leakage. The overall 
architecture is as follows:
```
            RAW IMAGE FILE
                    │
